# sentiment-analysis---amazon-reviews
The goal is to find commonalities between documents, with the understanding that similarly combined vectors should correspond to similar sentiments.  While the scope of sentiment analysis is very broad, we will focus our work in two ways.1. Polarity classification We won't try to determine if a sentence is objective or subjective, fact or opinion. Rather, we care only if the text expresses a positive, negative or neutral opinion.  2. Document level scope We'll also try to aggregate all of the sentences in a document or paragraph, to arrive at an overall opinion.  3. Coarse analysis We won't try to perform a fine-grained analysis that would determine the degree of positivity/negativity. That is, we're not trying to guess how many stars a reviewer awarded, just whether the review was positive or negative.
